<!-- When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the
page. The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects.

The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.

An HTML/XML document is represented inside the browser as the DOM tree. Tags become element
nodes and form the structure. Text becomes text nodes. -->
